We will use QGIS as a software, however, once you know one GIS system, you should be able to transfer your skills beyond GIS if desired/required.\nAfter this course you should… * be familiar with the common terminology and concepts in geospatial data analysis * know your toolbox of common GIS functions and be able to select and use the suitable GIS functions for your tasks * able to create, manipulate, analyze and visualize vector and raster data (in QGIS) * most importantly be able to independently use GIS beyond the example tasks of this course!"
