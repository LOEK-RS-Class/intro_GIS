## Why GIS in landscape ecology?



## Aims

In this course you will get an introductory overview of typical methods of geoinformatics in the field of landscape ecology.
We will use QGIS as a software, however, once you know one GIS system, you should be able to transfer your skills beyond GIS if desired/required.

After this course you should...
* be familiar with the common terminology and concepts in geospatial data analysis
* know your toolbox of common GIS functions and be able to select and use the suitable GIS functions for your tasks
* able to create, manipulate, analyze and visualize vector and raster data (in QGIS)
* most importantly be able to independently use GIS beyond the example tasks of this course!


## Course structure and study tasks
You should, to large parts, be able to use the material provided on these pages for self study.
However, if you are a student of Landscape ecology in MÃ¼nster, we highly recommend to take advantage of the in-person course programme.
See \href{https://studium.uni-muenster.de/qisserver} to find out when this course is offered.
